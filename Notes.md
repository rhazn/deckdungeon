- combat
  - characters have own values for armor/hp/attack
  - have own deck with cards like "deal your attack dmg to everyone", "deal 2x attack", "gain x armor", "buff"...
  - play in initiative order, can play as many as X cards or cards costing X (their speed?), every card above can also be played but is burned forever?
  - should have positions on field? probably not at first? maybe just 1d position like hearthstone?
