# Lootboxes
Lootboxes can contain [Heroes](Heroes.md), [Scenario Cards](Dungeons.md), [Resources](Resources.md) etc. Different types of lootboxes can contain different kinds of items (e.g. there can be a Hero lootbox, a Halloween lootbox, a Starter set).

Earning and opening lootboxes is one of the main mechanics of the game. In contrast to other games, lootboxes are not supposed to introduce a pay2win mechanic into the game but be part of the main gameplay loop. Therefore lootboxes are rewarded from [Dungeons](Dungeons.md) or similar systems and not bought from a store.

# Real life rewards
Long term it would be nice to be able to give out loot from real life events (like scanning a QR code to gain a lootbox ingame or scanning a real life card to gain the same card in the game). Not sure how to do that without introducing pay2win issues.
