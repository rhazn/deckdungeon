# Base
A user's base is some form of moving/flying location that they can pilot from location to location and upgrade in between. It can start out as a small airship and potentially end as a flying city (?).

A base can be permanently upgraded using [resources](./Resources.md) to provide more building slots or better buildings, similar to the Hamlet in Darkest Dungeon or the Avenger in X-Com 2. Buildings have different uses from bigger hero pools to being able to upgrade cards or permanent buffs during dungeon runs.
