# Combat
Combat is needed to resolve combat scenario cards.

Also combat is somewhat of a mystery but should be turn based. Also card based?

- three heroes vs "the card", have three lines from the bottom with skills from their skilldeck, skills can be just "do damage, do 2x damage, do 0.5x damage", skill up heroes by adding or destroying skills from your pool
- to play a skill, "flip" it up from the hero with your thumb
- heroes have X actions, can play X skills that get shuffled back in when deck empty. can play X*2 cards but x-2x cards get exhausted forever, hero without cards can do nothing
