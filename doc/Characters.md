# Characters
Characters are collected from [Lootboxes](./Lootboxes.md) and live in the [base](Base.md). Characters can be either generic templates with random art and name ("Human Fighter") or unique with specific art and backstory ("Alrik Westfal"). They come in different qualities (1-5 stars) that affect their stats and potentially different versions (foil, holiday themed ones...) that are purely visual. Everything in a hero, including quality, can be upgraded (potentially costly) so a player can take their favorite hero from nothing to perfect.

For gameplay mechanics a hero is a card containing:
- List of types ("Human fighter")
- A list of generic tags (?)
- Name, Artwork...
- A deck of their own cards
  - leveling up a hero could be done by including new cards in the deck or removing cards from the deck. For example removing a "1x Damage" card and adding a "2x Damage" card would increase overall dps.

# Story
Longterm characters can potentially have unique stories and affinities so they react to actions of the player, like/dislike each other etc.
