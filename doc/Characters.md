# Characters
Characters are collected from [Lootboxes](./Lootboxes.md) and live in the [base](Base.md). Characters can be either generic templates with random art and name ("Human Fighter") or unique with specific art and backstory ("Alrik Westfal"). They come in different qualities (1-5 stars) that affect their stats and potentially different versions (foil, holiday themed ones...) that are purely visual. Everything in a character, including quality, can be upgraded (potentially costly) so a player can take their favorite character from nothing to perfect.

# Data
A character consists of:
- A name
- Artwork
- Tags ("human", "fighter")
- Level
- Statistics
  - Hitpoints
  - Armor
  - Attack
  - Initiative
  - Actions
- A deck of [Skill Cards](./Card.md)

# Quality
Quality ranges from 1-5 stars and affects the values of statistics. A 1 star human fighter might have 5-10 hitpoints while a 5 star human fighter has 20-25. Character quality can be increased by combining lower quality characters with the right building in the [Base](./Base.md).

# Level
When leveling up users can change a characters deck by removing or adding cards (depending on what they have built in their [Base](./Base.md)). Characters can be improved by e.g. removing 0.5x damage cards or adding more 2x damage cards.

# Story
Longterm characters can potentially have unique stories and affinities so they react to actions of the player, like/dislike each other etc.
