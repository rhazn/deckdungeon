# World
Deckdungeons takes part in a high fantasy world with a generically mediaval technology level with early guns and steampunk elements, similar to Guild Wars 2.

Important people in the world travel by air, from small air ships to huge floating cities. Every player will have control over their own moving [base](./Base.md) and be able to build it up and fly it to new areas.

# Art Style
Colourful concept art style similar to [Guild Wars 2](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/media/concept-art/) or [Magic: The Gathering](https://www.artofmtg.com/). Maybe dark, gothic style similar to [Darkest Dungeon](https://www.darkestdungeon.com/media/)?
