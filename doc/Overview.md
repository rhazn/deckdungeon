# Deckdungeon

Deckdungeon is a cooperative roguelike collectible card game.

## Concepts
- Earning and opening loot boxes as core gameplay mechanic, not selling lootboxes
- Lots of GW2/MTG inspired concept art for cards
- Building perfect heroes from [drops/loot boxes](Lootboxes.md), inspired by games like Pokemon or Diablo

## Main Systems
- [Dungeon](Dungeons.md) exploration with a party of heroes to collect [ressources](Resources.md) and advance the map
- Build a [persistent base](Base.md) from those ressources
- Collect and customize a [party of heroes](Heroes.md)
