# Deckdungeon

Deckdungeon is a cooperative roguelike collectible [card](Card.md) game with a [great style](Style.md).

## Concepts
- Earning and opening loot boxes as core gameplay mechanic, not selling lootboxes
- Building perfect characters from [drops/loot boxes](Lootboxes.md), inspired by games like Pokemon or Diablo

## Main Systems
- [Dungeon](Dungeons.md) exploration with a party of characters to collect [ressources](Resources.md) and advance the map
- Build a [persistent base](Base.md) from those ressources
- Collect and customize a [party of characters](Characters.md)
- Trade cards and lootboxes on a [market](Market.md)

## Releases
- Alpha 1 (One preconfigured dungeon run)
- Alpha 2 (User accounts, saving dungeon run stats)
- Alpha 3 (Drops from dungeon run, customize characters from those)
