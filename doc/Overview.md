# Deckdungeon

Deckdungeon is a cooperative roguelike collectible card game with a [great style](Style.md).

## Concepts
- Earning and opening loot boxes as core gameplay mechanic, not selling lootboxes
- Building perfect heroes from [drops/loot boxes](Lootboxes.md), inspired by games like Pokemon or Diablo

## Main Systems
- [Dungeon](Dungeons.md) exploration with a party of heroes to collect [ressources](Resources.md) and advance the map
- Build a [persistent base](Base.md) from those ressources
- Collect and customize a [party of heroes](Heroes.md)
- Trade cards and lootboxes on a [market](Market.md)
