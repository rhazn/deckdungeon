# Overview
The alpha set will include a very limited set of characters and enough cards to build a random dungeon for a specific theme with a few bosses.

For the time being, there will be no foil cards and no different qualities.

# Style
The alpha will focus on steampunk and high fantasy magic, exploring the theme of a shattered world that consists of small to huge floating islands and cities and the airships travelling between them. Think MTG artifacts like [MTG Ornithopter](https://www.google.com/search?q=ornithopter+mtg+art) and [GW2 Engineer](https://www.google.com/search?q=guildwars2+engineer).
